/*2. Write a query to to find all employees whose last name starts and ends with 'E'. 
Use concat() to combine their first and last name together as a single column named full_name.*/

/*3. Convert the names produced in your last query to all uppercase.*/
SELECT upper(concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS 'full_name' FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'E%E';

/*4. Find all employees hired in the 90s and born on Christmas. Use datediff() function to find 
how many days they have been working at the company (Hint: You will also need to use NOW() or 
CURDATE()),*/

A username should be all lowercase, and consist of the first character of the employees first name, 
the first 4 characters of the employees last name, an underscore, the month the employee was born, and 
the last two digits of the year that they were born. Below is an example of what the first 10 rows will 
look like:*/
